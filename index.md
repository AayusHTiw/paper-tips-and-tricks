title: Tips and Tricks for Writing Scientific Papers
---

This website contains a list of tools, best practices, tips and other guidelines we found useful/important when writing scientific papers.
Some are a matter of style (we tend to follow the guidelines of the Chicago Manual of Style), and we are well aware that other people prefer to do things differently, but we list them anyway to have a consistent guide.
Feel free to adapt, change, ignore, or even challenge everything we write!
